        <h2>
            <p>
                Lakshmi Sahgal, born Lakshmi Swaminathan, was a revolutionary leader and freedom fighter who played 
                a significant role in the Indian independence movement. She was a close associate of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose 
                and served as an officer in the Indian National Army (INA).
            </p>
            <p>
                During World War II, Sahgal was appointed the head of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, the women's 
                regiment of the INA. Under her leadership, the regiment played a crucial role in supporting the 
                INA's efforts to liberate India from British rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                After India gained independence, Sahgal continued to be active in social and political causes, 
                advocating for women's rights, healthcare, and education. She remains an inspiration to generations 
                of Indians for her courage, leadership, and unwavering commitment to the cause of freedom.
